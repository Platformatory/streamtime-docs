# Confluent for Kubernetes (CFK)    
Confluent for Kubernetes (CFK) is a fully managed Kafka distribution optimized for Kubernetes environments. It provides a comprehensive set of features for deploying, managing, and scaling Kafka clusters with ease.
## Key Features
- **Managed Kafka**: Simplifies Kafka operations with automated deployment, scaling, and management.
- **Integration with Confluent Platform**: Seamlessly integrates with Confluent's ecosystem, including Schema Registry, KSQL, and Connect.
- **Kubernetes Native**: Designed specifically for Kubernetes, leveraging its capabilities for resource management and scaling.
- **Monitoring and Management**: Provides built-in monitoring and management tools for Kafka clusters, including metrics and logs.
- **Security**:
  - Supports TLS encryption, authentication, and authorization.
  - Integrates with Kubernetes RBAC for fine-grained access control.            
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Can be deployed across multiple cloud providers, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.

## How to Deploy CFK
Deploying Confluent for Kubernetes (CFK) using Streamtime is straightforward and can be done through the Streamtime UI. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create a Kafka Cluster**:
   - Use the Streamtime UI to create a new Kafka cluster.
   - Select "Confluent for Kubernetes" as the distribution type.

2. **Configure Cluster Settings**:
   - Choose a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, OCI, Azure) or use BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes).
   - Specify the region.
   - Specify the number of Kafka units (1 unit = 20 MBps throughput).
   - Set the tenancy model (`shared`, `isolated`, or `dedicated`).

3. **Fleet Selection**:
   - Choose the Kubernetes fleet where the Kafka cluster will be deployed.
   - Ensure the fleet is healthy and ready for deployment.

## Monitoring and Management
- **Metrics Dashboards**: Visualize key metrics such as throughput, latency, and error rates.
- **Logs**: Access Kafka logs for troubleshooting and auditing.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for critical events and performance issues.
- **Scaling**: Easily scale the Kafka cluster by adjusting the number of Kafka units or adding more nodes to the underlying Kubernetes fleet.
